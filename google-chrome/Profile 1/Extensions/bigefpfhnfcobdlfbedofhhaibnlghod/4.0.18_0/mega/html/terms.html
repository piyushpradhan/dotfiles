Mega Limited (&ldquo;<b>Mega</b>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<b>we</b>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<b>us</b>&rdquo;) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption. Using Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (&ldquo;<b>UCE</b>&rdquo;), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call &ldquo;<b>data</b>&rdquo; in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, &ldquo;<b>services</b>&rdquo; and each, a &ldquo;<b>service</b>&rdquo;). We provide our services ourselves and via our <a class="clickurl" href="/contact">related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers</a> who act on our behalf, at our websites at <a href="https://mega.nz">https://mega.nz</a> and <a href="https://mega.io">https://mega.io</a>, subdomains and related sites (&ldquo;<b>websites</b>&rdquo;), using our mobile apps (&ldquo;<b>mobile apps</b>&rdquo;), our desktop apps (&ldquo;<b>desktop apps</b>&rdquo;), our command line tools (&ldquo;<b>cmd tools</b>&rdquo;), our browser extensions (&ldquo;<b>browser extensions</b>&rdquo;) and our application programming interface (&ldquo;<b>API</b>&rdquo;). If you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our <a class="clickurl" href="/help">Help Centre</a> or, if you can't find the answer there, check our <a class="clickurl" href="/contact">contacts</a> page for details of who to contact. </span> </p> <p> <span class="number">2</span> <span class="text"> <b>Important:</b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe. If you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (&ldquo;<b>GDPR</b>&rdquo;). By agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access. </span> </p> <p> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="text"> These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services. By using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms. If you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services. In particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51. NEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53. </span> </p> <p> <span class="number">4</span> <span class="text"> We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide. Your continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms. If you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force. We will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account. For more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60. </span> </p> <p> <span class="number">5</span> <span class="text"> If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for. </span> </p> <h2 id="your_data">Your data</h2> <p> <span class="number">6</span> <span class="text"> If you allow others to access your data (e.g. by giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms. This is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below). </span> </p> <p> <span class="number">7</span> <span class="text"> UCE is fundamental to our services. This means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data. You should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential. You must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data. <b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data</b>. Encryption won&rsquo;t help though if someone has full access to your system or device. We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g. via unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices). Mega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us. </span> </p> <p> <span class="number">8</span> <span class="text"> You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services. We do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free. You should download all data prior to termination of services. </span> </p> <p> <span class="number">9</span> <span class="text"> Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication). In that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms. Any right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user. </span> </p> <p> <span class="number">10</span> <span class="text"> We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to. If you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data. <br><br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes. See also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated. <br><br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data. </span> </p> <h2 id="your_obligations">Your obligations</h2> <p> <span class="number">11</span> <span class="text"> Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our <a class="clickurl" href="/contact">related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers</a>), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).

Where we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement </span> </p> <p> <span class="number">13</span> <span class="text"> If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): </span> </p> <p class="list"> <span class="number">13.1</span> <span class="text">suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or;</span> </p> <p class="list"> <span class="number">13.2</span> <span class="text"> require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.
